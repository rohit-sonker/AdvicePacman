# AdvicePacman

This project aims to understand the how expert advice can be leveraged in Q-Learning to speed up the learning process. Two cases are analysed with a baseline - 

- Crowdsourcing advice from multiple experts
- Advice by a single expert
- No advice baseline

The testing environment is based on the Pacman Project by UC Berkeley

Please refer to the report for details.
